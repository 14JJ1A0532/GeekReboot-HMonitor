Problem space:-
  Pandemics are the most challenging and dangerous international disasters. But there is hope.
  The larger the gathering, the greater the chance of getting afftected by corona virus
  The probability of an individual affecting by virus in small gatherings is less compared to the one in large groups
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solution space:-
  A device system to count the number of people in any place by analysing a video via IP Camera of Drone or Mobile device or it can also analyse a recorded video file.

  Using millions of training data images of crowded areas, computer vision cameras can be trained to detect neighbourhoods whose people might be at riskto prevent mass contamination. Also, such areas can be disinfected on time, if necessary.

  We can surely flatten the curve of COVID19 spread in communities with this preventive solution.

Tech Stack:-

1. Python 3.x
2. YOLOv3
3. OpenCV

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Goals:-
  To reduce the percentage of people prone to the pandemic.
  To provide a better tracking system and proper measurement of people density in various areas.
  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conclusion:-

This hence helps us to control the spread of pandemic.
